Eight Queens Problem with Zone Exclusion Heuristic
This approach combines backtracking with a zone exclusion heuristic to prioritize placements that are less likely to lead to dead ends.

1. Problem: Eight Queens

The goal is to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other (share the same row, column, or diagonal).

2. Algorithm:

a. Data Structures:

board: A 2D array of size 8x8 representing the chessboard (0 for empty, 1 for queen placement).
b. Zone Exclusion Heuristic:

Define exclusion zones around each placed queen.
These zones encompass diagonals and the entire column where the queen resides.
When placing a new queen, prioritize empty cells with fewer existing queens in their exclusion zones.
c. Steps:

Recursive Backtracking:

solveNQueens(col) function takes the current column index.
Base Case: If col == 8 (all columns filled), a solution is found. Return true.
Recursive Case:
Loop through all rows i in col:
Check if isSafe(i, col) returns true (no conflicts).
For each valid row i:
Calculate a score based on the number of existing queens in the exclusion zone around cell (i, col). Lower score indicates higher priority.
Prioritize rows with lower scores for queen placement (e.g., using a priority queue).
Place a queen at board[i][col].
If solveNQueens(col + 1) returns true (solution found), return true (optional: stop after one solution).
Backtrack by removing the queen from board[i][col].
isSafe Function:

Given a row i and column col, check if placing a queen at board[i][col] is safe (no conflicts).
3. Based From: Dynamic + Own Algorithm

This approach uses a backtracking framework similar to the classic solution but incorporates a heuristic to guide placement decisions. This avoids the overhead of a full dynamic programming table.

4. Sample Code (C#):

C#
public class EightQueensHeuristic
{
    public static int[,] board = new int[8, 8];

    public static bool isSafe(int row, int col)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < col; i++)
        {
            if (board[row, i] == 1 || Math.Abs(row - i) == Math.Abs(col - i))
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static int getExclusionZoneScore(int row, int col)
    {
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < col; i++)
        {
            if (board[row, i] == 1)
            {
                score++; // Queen in the same row
            }
            int diagLeft = row - (col - i);
            int diagRight = row + (col - i);
            if (diagLeft >= 0 && diagLeft < 8 && board[diagLeft, i] == 1)
            {
                score++; // Queen in the left diagonal
            }
            if (diagRight >= 0 && diagRight < 8 && board[diagRight, i] == 1)
            {
                score++; // Queen in the right diagonal
            }
        }
        return score;
    }

    public static bool solveNQueens(int col)
    {
        if (col == 8)
        {
            return true; // All columns filled, solution found
        }

        // Use a priority queue to prioritize rows with lower exclusion zone scores
        PriorityQueue<Cell, int> pq = new PriorityQueue<Cell, int>();
        for (int row = 0; row < 8; row++)
        {
            if (isSafe(row, col))
            {
                pq.Enqueue(new Cell(row, col), getExclusionZoneScore(row, col));
            }
        }

        while (pq.Count > 0)
        {
            Cell cell = pq.Dequeue();
            int row = cell.Row;
            int col = cell.Col;

            board[row, col] = 1;
            if (solveNQueens(col + 1
